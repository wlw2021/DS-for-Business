# Feedback for proposals

Wow- 4 proposals!!

\#1: I always like a good movie recco project, but do you have thoughts as to what model you would fit? For instance, based on the data you list here, it looks like you can use year and genre as features, but thhose are not that interesting. (e.g. just recommending comedies from 1998 is not a very useful recommender) - do you have ideas on how you can get more features or go deeper. (maybe someone on the team has experience with these models?)

\#2 is a pretty clean, basic (dare i say boring?) dataset for diabetes prediction that would be fine for a project. All binary variables. Fine fallback choice if needed. 

\#3. I havent seen this data before, it seems intersting and rich. Mix of categorical and integer variables, and you give a good business motivation. Only 600 or so observations but hopefully you can find some signal.

\#4 seems like it might be interesting but I dont really understand the data or task as written : 1) the "large twitch features" data - not clear to me what the rows are or how they tie into the other data set (for instance the numeric_id in the graph data doesnt seem to be in the features data) . Im actually not sure what each row in the features data represents. Finally, Im not sure what you mean by classifying as "potential or limited" as these labels dont appear in the files (and you would need training data).
